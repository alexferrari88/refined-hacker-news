## Developing

### Workflows

To run the extension in development:

1. Clone the repository
2. [Install](#installing) and [run](#running)
3. Enable development extensions in [Chrome](#chrome) or [Firefox](#firefox)

### Installing

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the fork locally and navigate to the containing folder
3. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Install the [stylus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylus) package globally:

   ```sh
   npm install -g stylus
   ```

### Running

To run the development server in watch mode:

```sh
npm run watch
```

### Enabling Developer Extensions

#### Chrome

In order to access the development build in Chrome, you must enable developer extensions.

1. Open Chrome
1. Navigate to [`chrome://extensions/`](chrome://extensions/) (`More Tools` > `Extensions`)
1. Enable `Developer mode` in the top-right corner
1. Click `Load unpacked`
1. Select the `dist` folder of the project directory

#### Firefox

In order to access the development build in Firefox, you can either run it on the command-line via [`web-ext`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext) or load it as a temporary add-on.

To run via command-line (with automatic reloading when files change):

1. Install `web-ext` globally:

   ```sh
   npm install -g web-ext
   ```

2. Make sure the development build is running (in watch mode)
3. Navigate into the `dist` directory, and run `web-ext`:

   ```sh
   web-ext run
   ```

This will open a browser with the add-on loaded.

To load as a temporary add-on:

1. Open Firefox
1. Navigate to [`about:debugging`](about:debugging)
1. Click `Enable add-on debugging`
1. Click `Load Temporary Add-on` and select the `manifest.json` file in the `dist` directory

### Linting

To run all linting:

```sh
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting errors:

```sh
npm run lint-fix
```
